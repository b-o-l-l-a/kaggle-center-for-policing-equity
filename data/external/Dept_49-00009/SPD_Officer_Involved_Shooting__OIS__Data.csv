One of the officers noticed that the subject was wearing a handgun in a holster on his right hip. It was illegal for the subject to possess a firearm because he was a convicted felon. The subject walked away from the vehicle and disappeared in to the residence that the officers were surveilling. After contacting their Sergeant to request resources and assistance to arrest the subject, both officers prepared their outer garment so they exposed ""POLICE"" and ""SEATTLE POLICE"" in bold lettering. The officers planned to wait and arrest the subject when he left the residence. The officers saw the subject leave the apartment. An unknown vehicle arrived and parked temporarily obstructing the officers’ view, and they lost sight of the subject. About a minute later, the officers saw another vehicle approach and pull next to the curb behind the subject’s vehicle. The subject opened the passenger door and stood between the passenger door and the vehicle. Both officers believed that the subject was going to move towards his own vehicle. The officers pointed their weapons at the subject and began giving loud verbal commands including “Hands up” and “Get on the ground.” As the officers moved towards the subject, they believed that the subject was reaching for and drawing the firearm from the holster on his right hip.  The officers opened fire, striking the subject. 

The subject was treated by medics at the scene. A loaded .45 caliber pistol was recovered from the passenger floorboard of the car that the subject had exited, and a matching holster was cut from subject's belt as he was being treated at the scene. The subject was transported to Harborview Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.  ."
